 //todo it would be fun to have limited slide mode where velocity is totally unlock from ship rotation
        //this would mean that for a short time the ship could rotate independant of its velocity then would resume velocity alignment
        //this is a post v0.1 of the ai though
        //might be fun to have dynamic areodynamic values too

        //todo calculate turn radius based on speed
        //todo dynamic engine power
        //it could be fun to disconnect craft orientation from craft velocity for a short while
        
        //make ai smart bout what their craft can do, if it rolls quickly have it roll to target then pitch up, if it yaws have it bank normally
        





		try plotting a path around obstacles by taking the inital avoidance steering direction and advancing it n units (5ish?) and check if in 
		x = number of frames to reach point, then recompute a steering direction from there, continue until path to target is clear / reached target
		or ran out of frames (if limited)
